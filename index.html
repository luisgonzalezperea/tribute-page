            <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's the time line of Canada's history</h2>
            <p class="main-text">--- The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated
                from Siberia by
                way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.</br></br>
                --- It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif
                Erikson. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied
                sporadically for perhaps 20 years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. No further
                European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's
                Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England.</br></br>
                --- In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's,
                Newfoundland, as the first North American English seasonal camp. In 1600, the French established their
                first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence. French explorer Samuel de Champlain
                arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal (in
                1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).</br></br>
                --- The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of
                Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince
                Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament
                passed the Quebec Act 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.</br></br>
                --- Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act 1867 officially
                proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova
                Scotia, and New Brunswick.</br></br>
                --- Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America
                Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I.</br></br>
                --- The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship
                across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in
                Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s
                and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared
                effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay
                underscored Canada's independence.</br></br>
                --- Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led
                to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the
                implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official
                multiculturalism in 1971.</br></br>
